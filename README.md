# alpaca-map-nextjs 🦙 🗺

Accessible Alpaca map app with search, React.js UI using Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose 💖

Migrate from previous alpaca map app that was using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and handcoded CSS to using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
